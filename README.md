# Blocky
Blocky is game in which you control a square snaking around the scree. 
It has a (yet not really working) interpreter for you to type commands for Blocky to execute.
It will have: if(parameters){commands\n more commands},ifNot,md,mu,mr,ml,(The command mu for example stand for move up, md for move down,...),while and maybe          whileNot.
The booleans for you to utilise in the parantheses are: isBarrierLeft,isBarrierTop,isBarrierRight,isBarrierDown and isFinished.
As mentioned earlier, the interpreter(which is developed purely in python, without modules) is in development and yet not implemented in the main game.

You can also manually move blocky via wasd after you clicked the "MM"-Button at the right which stands for manual moving.

Enjoy, Lars
