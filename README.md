# Blocky
Blocky is game in which you control a square snaking around the screen.<br> 
It has a (yet not really working) interpreter for you to type commands for Blocky to execute.<br>
It will have: if(parameters){commands\n more commands},ifNot,md,mu,mr,ml,(The command mu for example stand for move up, md for move down,...),while and maybe          whileNot.<br>
The booleans for you to utilise in the parantheses are: isBarrierLeft,isBarrierTop,isBarrierRight,isBarrierDown and isFinished.<br>
As mentioned earlier, the interpreter(which is developed purely in python, without modules) is in development and yet not implemented in the main game.<br>
<br>
You can also manually move blocky via wasd after you clicked the "MM"-Button at the right which stands for manual moving.<br>
<br>
By pressing "q" you open the advanced level creator, by clicking once you set the start point, the second click sets the end point and afterwards you can add as many barriers as you wish to.<br>
If you are finished, just press "q" again and after you fire up the game a second time you should be able to play your level.(It is possible to create impossible and broken level :) )<br>
<br>
Enjoy, Lars
